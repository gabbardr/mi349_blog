<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Randi Marie Gabbard. If you could not already tell from my posts, I am a huge ice cream fanatic.
 I grew up in southeast Michigan suburban city, about 45 minutes north of Detroit. Growing up, I lived right by a Dairy Queen, which
 peaked my interests. You could say I was a frequent customer, then turned to full time employee around my junior year of high school.
 Within about a year, I was promoted to manager and still work for the company present day almost 5 years later! Today, I still am a
 a major ice cream fanatic, and look to provide useful, yet interesting information to the public! </p>
