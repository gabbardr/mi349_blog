<h2>Dairy Queen vs. Cold Stone: Ice Cream Cake Addition</h2>
<p>When it comes to ice cream cakes, which ice cream-based store does it better: Dairy Queen or Cold Stone? With summer here, ice cream cakes seem to be growing in desire for any type of holiday, family gathering, birthday, and even just as a treat! Although, the biggest question is faced: where to get the cake from? It seems as if almost any major ice cream-based chain is now offering ice cream cakes for customers, but each chain also has very different types of ice cream cakes. The two biggest competitors for ice cream cakes right now are Dairy Queen and Cold Stone, but often times, customers do not even know there is a difference between the two! What is the difference you wonder? No need to fear, we broke down the major differences within the cakes for you already.</p> 
   
<p>Dairy Queen ice cream cakes:</p>
<ul class="comparelistdairy">
    <li>Soft serve ice cream: cakes are made with Dairy Queen's signature soft serve recipe!</li>
    <li>All ice cream: Dairy Queen cakes are made with no actual cake.</li>
    <li>Extremely customizable: from additives to decoration, there is endless possibilities for the customer to choose from if desired. Even images can be added!</li>
    </ul>

<p>Cold Stone ice cream cakes:</p>
<ul class="comparelistcold">
    <li>Hard serve ice cream: cakes are made with the hard serve flavors that Cold Stone has to offer at the time of creation!</li>
    <li>Has real cake: layered within the ice cream contains real layers of flavored cake!</li>
    <li>Moderately customizable: customer can choose flavorings and occasionally choose the decorations within and top of the cake.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Popular Dairy Queen Items</h2>
<p>Everybody loves a little bit of ice cream now and again, and during summer, ice cream shops increase the options they offer leaving us customers overwhelmed when trying to decide which flavor to choose! Have no fear, I am here to help you know and decide what options you might be most interested in! We will start off with the popular ice cream chain store: Dairy Queen.</p>

<p>Blizzards:</p>
<ul class="blizzards">
    <li>Oreo: This top selling tasty treat contains just vanilla ice cream and Oreos! If you like Oreos and something that isn’t super light or heavy, this is the perfect blizzard for you</li>
    <li>Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough: This blizzard contains cookie dough chunks, cold fudge, and vanilla ice cream. The cold fudge tends to be a predominate ingredient but gives the chocolate chips in the cookie dough a complimenting flavor. Also, a top seller!</li>
    <li>M&M: This classic blizzard contains chocolate sauce, M&M’s, and vanilla ice cream. The chocolate sauce tends to be overpowering in this blizzard. If you love chocolate and M&M’s, then this is a good match! If you are worried about the abundance of chocolate either go all out and request chocolate ice cream too or ask for little to no chocolate sauce!</li>
    </ul>

<p>Cone Dips:</p>
<ul class="conedips">
    <li>Chocolate: This cone dip is a perfect for first time triers! This flavor cone dip compliments each possible cone flavor extremely well. It also tastes just like chocolate</li>
    <li>Cherry: This cone dip is one of the sweetest flavors Dairy Queen has ever made for a dip. It is a bright red dip that taste very similar to any artificial strawberry flavoring.</li>
    <li>Dreamsicle: The newest addition to the cone dips is Dreamsicle! Dreamsicle is an orange dip that tastes similarly to orange sherbet flavoring. It can taste funky with the chocolate ice cream, so it is recommended to be used with vanilla only!</li>
    </ul>
